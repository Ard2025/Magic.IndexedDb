# How The LINQ to IndexDB works
### **Bridging the Gap Between C# and IndexedDB**

C# developers are accustomed to **relational databases** where LINQ allows seamless **querying, filtering, sorting, and pagination** directly at the database level. However, **IndexedDB is a non-relational key-value store**, meaning that **not all LINQ operations have a direct IndexedDB equivalent**.

This system enables **LINQ-style queries** to be dynamically **translated into IndexedDB operations**, while **handling the gaps in functionality** through **in-memory processing** and **custom query structuring**.

To use this effectively, developers must understand:

1. **What can be executed directly in IndexedDB** ✅
2. **What requires in-memory processing** ⚡
3. **How queries are broken into chunks** 🧩
4. **How non-relational data is handled** 🏗️
5. **What works efficiently vs. what’s a performance bottleneck** 🚀

## **Understanding IndexedDB's Limitations**

IndexedDB is **not a relational database**. It: ✔ **Supports key-value storage with object stores.**  
✔ **Can index specific fields for faster lookups.**  
✔ **Allows range-based queries (`>`, `<`, `=`) on indexed fields.**

However, it ❌ **does NOT support complex relational operations**:

- ❌ **No `JOIN`s** → IndexedDB has no concept of foreign keys.
- ❌ **Limited `.Where()` capabilities** → Only indexed fields can be queried efficiently.
- ❌ **No `.Skip()` or `.Take()`** → IndexedDB does not support row-based offsets.
- ❌ **No full-text search (`Contains()`, `StartsWith()`)** → Must be handled in memory.

To **emulate relational database behavior**, we: ✔ **Break queries into parts** (fetch indexed data first, then process in memory).  
✔ **Use cursors to handle pagination**.  
✔ **Apply complex filters after retrieving data**.

Here's a **fully revised and expanded** version of the documentation, starting from **"2. How LINQ Queries Are Translated"**. This version ensures that it properly documents **your implementation, including the cursor optimizations, memory filtering, ordering logic, and IndexedDB query translation**.

# **How LINQ Queries Are Translated**

### **From LINQ to IndexedDB: A Step-by-Step Breakdown**

C# developers are used to **declarative LINQ queries** where everything is processed in the database, but IndexedDB is a key-value store with limited querying capabilities.

This section details how **LINQ queries** are **broken down into IndexedDB-compatible steps**, ensuring that operations occur in the correct order while preserving performance and correctness.

---

## **2.1 Translating a Sample LINQ Query**

Let's take a typical C# LINQ query:

```csharp
var results = db.People
    .Where(x => x.Age > 30 && x.Name.StartsWith("Jo"))
    .OrderBy(x => x.Age)
    .Skip(10)
    .Take(5)
    .ToList();
```

### **Step-by-Step IndexedDB Execution**

|**Step**|**Operation**|**Where It’s Executed**|
|---|---|---|
|**1**|**Filter by Indexed Field (`x.Age > 30`)**|✅ **IndexedDB (if indexed)** → Else, **in-memory**|
|**2**|**Filter by Non-Indexed Field (`x.Name.StartsWith("Jo")`)**|✅ **IndexedDB cursor range query (optimized!)**|
|**3**|**Sort (`OrderBy(x => x.Age)`)**|✅ **IndexedDB (if indexed)** → Else, **in-memory**|
|**4**|**Pagination (`Skip(10)`, `Take(5)`)**|❌ **IndexedDB does not support `.Skip()`** → **Simulated via cursor**|
|**5**|**Final Processing (Distinct, custom transforms)**|⚡ **In-memory**|

---

## **2.2 Breaking Queries Into Executable Chunks**

### **Phase 1: Use IndexedDB Where Possible**

IndexedDB can efficiently handle:

- **Direct equality checks (`x.Age == 30`)**
- **Range filters (`x.Age > 30`)**
- **Sorting (`OrderBy`)** (only on indexed fields)
- **Optimized `.StartsWith()` filtering** (via range queries)
- **Fetching specific keys with `.anyOf([values])`**

Whenever a query includes **indexed fields**, IndexedDB directly retrieves and processes the data, avoiding unnecessary memory overhead.

✅ **IndexedDB filtering happens before retrieval, reducing memory consumption.**

---

### **Phase 2: Handling Non-Indexed Conditions in Memory**

For **non-indexed fields**, additional filtering must happen **after retrieval** in memory. This applies to:

- `.Contains("John")` (Full-text search is unsupported in IndexedDB)
- `.EndsWith("son")` (IndexedDB has no native support for suffix matching)

⚡ **Warning:** In-memory processing requires **fetching all data first**, which is inefficient for large datasets.

---

### **Phase 3: Sorting**

Sorting is performed in **IndexedDB if the field is indexed**, otherwise it happens **in memory**.

- ✅ **`OrderBy(x => x.Age)`** (IndexedDB handles this efficiently if `Age` is indexed)
- ❌ **`OrderBy(x => x.Name)`** (Requires in-memory sorting if `Name` is not indexed)

⚠️ **Sorting large datasets in memory can be slow. Prefer IndexedDB-based sorting.**

---

### **Phase 4: Pagination Using Cursors**

IndexedDB **does not support `.Skip(n)`**, so pagination must be simulated efficiently. The best approach is to **use cursors** to fetch only the necessary records.

🚀 **Optimized Cursor-Based Pagination**

Instead of fetching all records into memory, a cursor advances until reaching the required `Skip(n)`, ensuring minimal memory usage.

✅ **Only the required records are loaded, reducing performance bottlenecks.**

---

## **3. Execution Order**

|**Step**|**Operation**|**Where It’s Executed**|
|---|---|---|
|**1**|**Where() - Indexed fields**|**IndexedDB**|
|**2**|**Where() - Non-indexed fields**|**In-memory (post-fetch filtering)**|
|**3**|**OrderBy() - Indexed fields**|**IndexedDB**|
|**4**|**OrderBy() - Non-indexed fields**|**In-memory**|
|**5**|**Pagination (Skip, Take)**|**IndexedDB Cursor**|
|**6**|**Final Processing (Distinct, transforms, etc.)**|**In-memory**|

---

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Use IndexedDB for filtering and sorting whenever possible.**
- **Avoid `.Contains()` and `.EndsWith()` on large datasets (they require full memory loading).**
- **Sorting should be done in IndexedDB if an index exists.**
- **Skip/Take are simulated using IndexedDB cursors.**
- **Breaking queries into IndexedDB-executable parts improves performance significantly.**

## **4. Understanding IndexedDB’s Strengths and Weaknesses**

|**LINQ Operation**|**Native IndexedDB Support?**|**Handled in Memory?**|
|---|---|---|
|**Where(x => x.Age > 30)**|✅ If Indexed|⚠️ If Not Indexed|
|**Where(x => x.Name.Contains("John"))**|❌ No|✅ Yes|
|**OrderBy(x => x.Age)**|✅ If Indexed|⚠️ If Not Indexed|
|**Skip(10), Take(5)**|❌ No|✅ Simulated via Cursor|
|**Join (x.Include(y))**|❌ No|✅ Manual Fetching|

✅ **By structuring queries efficiently, you can maximize IndexedDB’s strengths while minimizing in-memory processing.** 🚀

## **Final Thoughts**

🔹 **IndexedDB is not a relational database, so not all LINQ operations have direct equivalents.**  
🔹 **IndexedDB queries must be broken into parts, with some processing happening in memory.**  
🔹 **Performance depends on proper indexing—non-indexed queries must load entire tables into memory.**  
🔹 **Developers should structure their queries to take advantage of IndexedDB’s strengths while minimizing in-memory processing.**

By understanding **what runs in IndexedDB vs. what runs in memory**, developers can write efficient **LINQ-like queries** in IndexedDB without performance pitfalls. 🚀

I am actually not an IndexDB expert! Want to make this project better? Be a hero and make suggestions or PR's. Because there's tons of performance improvements that can be made!

### Current Goals
1.) Move more of the unsupported conditions to the cursor to provide better performance.
2.) More emulation in general utilizing cursors.
